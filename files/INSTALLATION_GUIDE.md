## Advanced Configuration

### Changing Application Colors

Edit `boutique_management_system.py`:

```python
# Lines 44-51 in Config class
COLOR_PRIMARY = "#8B0000"    # Deep Maroon - Change this
COLOR_SECONDARY = "#FFD700"  # Gold - Change this
COLOR_ACCENT = "#C76D7E"     # Rose Gold - Change this
```

Popular color schemes:
- **Blue Theme**: Primary=#1E3A8A, Secondary=#3B82F6, Accent=#60A5FA
- **Green Theme**: Primary=#065F46, Secondary=#10B981, Accent=#34D399
- **Purple Theme**: Primary=#5B21B6, Secondary=#A855F7, Accent=#C084FC

# Line 48 in Config class
ADMIN_PIN = "1234"  # Change to your preferred PIN
```

Save and restart application.

### Customizing Invoice Template

The invoice generation is in the `InvoiceGenerator` class (starts around line 250).

You can customize:
- Colors
- Fonts
- Layout

## Security Best Practices

### Initial Setup Security

1. **Change default password immediately**
   - Use strong password (8+ characters, mixed case, numbers)
   - Store securely

2. **Change Admin PIN**
   - Don't use 1234, 0000, 1111
   - Make it memorable but not obvious

3. **Protect database file**
   - Store in secure location
   - Regular backups
   - Don't share on public networks

### Ongoing Security

1. **Regular backups**
   - Weekly: Copy database to external drive
   - Monthly: Full system backup
   - Test restore process

2. **Access control**
   - Limit who has admin PIN
   - Individual user accounts for staff (future enhancement)

3. **Physical security**
   - Lock computer when away
   - Screen privacy filter (optional)
   - Secure workspace
