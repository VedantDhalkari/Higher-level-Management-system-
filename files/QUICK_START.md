Today's Sales = How much money made today
Inventory Value = Total worth of all stock
Low Stock Alert = Items to reorder
```

### Bill Summary
```
Subtotal = Price × Quantity (all items)
Discount = Subtotal × Discount %
After Discount = Subtotal - Discount
GST = After Discount × 5%
Final Total = After Discount + GST
```

### Stock Colors
```
Green = Sufficient stock
Red = Low stock (≤5 items)
Red Border = Needs immediate attention
```
