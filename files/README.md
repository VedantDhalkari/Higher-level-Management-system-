pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "BoutiqueManagement" --icon=logo.ico boutique_management_system.py
```

**Explanation of flags**:
- `--onefile`: Creates a single executable file
- `--windowed`: No console window (clean GUI-only app)
- `--name`: Name of the executable
- `--icon`: Application icon (optional - create logo.ico if you have one)

#### 3. Advanced Compilation (Recommended)
For a more complete package with all dependencies:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed ^
    --name "BoutiqueManagement" ^
    --icon=logo.ico ^
    --add-data "logo.png;." ^
    --hidden-import=reportlab.graphics.barcode ^
    --hidden-import=reportlab.graphics.charts ^
    --collect-all customtkinter ^
    boutique_management_system.py
```

#### 4. Locate Your Executable
After compilation (takes 2-5 minutes):
